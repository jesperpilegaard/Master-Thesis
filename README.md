This thesis aims to deploy a chatbot based on the ChatGPT architecture, utilizing extensive event data from the Danish Superliga for a comprehensive analysis of football matches.

Through the integration of machine learning, natural language processing and prompt engineering the chatbot will dynamically provide insights into various match events, including goals, assists, shots, saves, and more.

We will be working with Event Data from OPTA, which is a sports analytics company, providing data for more than 30 sports, including the Danish Superliga. There are 2000-3000 events recorded for each match.

Event data bear information about who is involved and when and where the event took place. Moreover there are a posteriori statistics such as how much thread a cross made,
the probability of scoring, etc. A match has 1.5MB of data plus the lineup of the players.
Additionally, we willll include precomputed statistics such as goals scored by each team
and the player responsible, assists, shots on and off target, saves by goalkeepers, free
kicks awarded and taken, corner kicks, offsides, yellow and red cards issued, ball pos
session time for each team, and pass accuracy.
The goal is to provide valuable insights in the form of text responses and/or data visual
izations for football coaches and analysts. Examples are small questions of a descriptive
nature, player comparison, or question about the location of certain events (eg, crosses).
In our tests we will use historical data from the last season.
